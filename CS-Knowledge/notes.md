## On Numbers and Strings

Why large numbers cannot be compared but strings can?

The key difference between storing numbers as integers and storing them as strings lies in how they are represented and processed in memory.

When you store a number as an integer, the computer needs to be able to perform arithmetic operations on it (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.). To do this efficiently, the computer represents the number as a binary value. The size of the integer type (like int, long, short, etc.) determines the range of numbers it can represent. For example, a 64-bit integer can represent numbers up to 2^64 - 1. If a number exceeds this range, it can't be stored in a 64-bit integer because there aren't enough bits to represent it.

On the other hand, when you store a number as a string, each digit is stored as a separate character. The computer doesn't need to perform arithmetic operations on the characters, so it doesn't need to represent the entire number as a single binary value. This means that a string can represent a number of any size, as long as there's enough memory to store each digit as a separate character. However, if you want to perform arithmetic operations on the number represented by the string, you would need to convert it to an integer or implement the arithmetic operations yourself.

So, the reason why strings can represent larger numbers than integers is not because strings are inherently capable of storing larger values, but because they represent numbers in a different way that doesn't require the entire number to be stored as a single binary value.
