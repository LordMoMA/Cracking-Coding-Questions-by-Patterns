Note: heapq in Python is minHeap

In Python, the heapq module implements a min heap, but you can implement a max heap byÂ **negating the values before adding them to the heap and negating them again when extracting the maximum value**. In Python 3.9 and above, there is a built-in heap module that you can use to create a max heap.

LeetCode Questions:

295. [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/?utm_source=LCUS&utm_medium=ip_redirect&utm_campaign=transfer2china)
 
 TheÂ **median**Â is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

- For example, forÂ `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median isÂ `3`.
- For example, forÂ `arr = [2,3]`, the median isÂ `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

- `MedianFinder()`Â initializes theÂ `MedianFinder`Â object.
- `void addNum(int num)`Â adds the integerÂ `num`Â from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()`Â returns the median of all elements so far. Answers withinÂ `10-5`Â of the actual answer will be accepted.
 
**Example 1:**
```bash
**Input**
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
**Output**
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0 

**Constraints:**

- `-105 <= num <= 105`
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before callingÂ `findMedian`.
- At mostÂ `5 * 104`Â calls will be made toÂ `addNum`Â andÂ `findMedian`.


[1,2,3,4,5,6]
minHeap = [4,5,6]
maxHeap = [3,2,1]
```

Solutions:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

# make minHeap one number more than maxHeap 
# minHeap stores the larger half of the numbers

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        self.minHeap = []
        self.maxHeap = []
        
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        heappush(self.minHeap, num)
        heappush(self.maxHeap, -heappop(self.minHeap))
        if len(self.maxHeap) > len(self.minHeap):
            heappush(self.minHeap, -heappop(self.maxHeap)) 

        
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.minHeap) == len(self.maxHeap):
            return (self.minHeap[0] - self.maxHeap[0]) / 2 # careful, maxHeap is always negative
        return self.minHeap[0]

# time complexity: O(logn), space complexity: O(n)
```

#### Time complexityÂ 

The time complexity of theÂ `insertNum()`Â will beÂ O(logN)Â due to the insertion in the heap. The time complexity of theÂ `findMedian()`Â will beÂ O(1)Â as we can find the median from the top elements of the heaps.

#### Space complexityÂ 

The space complexity will beÂ O(N)Â because, as at any time, we will be storing all the numbers.

[502.Â IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)

Suppose LeetCode will start itsÂ **IPO**Â soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before theÂ **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at mostÂ `k`Â distinct projects before theÂ **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at mostÂ `k`Â distinct projects.

You are givenÂ `n`Â projects where theÂ `ith`Â project has a pure profitÂ `profits[i]`Â and a minimum capital ofÂ `capital[i]`Â is needed to start it.

Initially, you haveÂ `w`Â capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list ofÂ **at most**Â `k`Â distinct projects from given projects toÂ **maximize your final capital**, and returnÂ _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 105`
- `0 <= w <= 109`
- `n == profits.length`
- `n == capital.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= profits[i] <= 104`
- `0 <= capital[i] <= 109`

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, w: int, profits: List[int], capital: List[int]) -> int:

        minCapitalHeap = []
        maxProfitHeap = []
        for i in range(0, len(profits)):
            heappush(minCapitalHeap, (capital[i], i))

        availableCapital = w
        for _ in range(k):
            while minCapitalHeap and minCapitalHeap[0][0] <= availableCapital:
                _, i = heappop(minCapitalHeap)
                heappush(maxProfitHeap, (-profits[i], i))

            if not maxProfitHeap:
                break
            
            availableCapital += -heappop(maxProfitHeap)[0]
        return availableCapital
```

#### Time complexityÂ 

Since, at the most, all the projects will be pushed to both the heaps once, the time complexity of our algorithm isÂ O(NlogN+KlogN),Â where â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of projects and â€˜Kâ€™ is the number of projects we are selecting.

#### Space complexityÂ 

The space complexity will beÂ O(N)Â because we will be storing all the projects in the heaps.


### Next Interval (hard)Â  (VIP ðŸ¤”)

Given an array of intervals, find the next interval of each interval. In a list of intervals, for an interval â€˜iâ€™ its next interval â€˜jâ€™ will have the smallest â€˜startâ€™ greater than or equal to the â€˜endâ€™ of â€˜iâ€™.

Write a function to return an array containing indices of the next interval of each input interval. If there is no next interval of a given interval, return -1. It is given that none of the intervals have the same start point.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:**Â Intervals [[2,3], [3,4], [5,6]]  
> **Output:**Â [1, 2, -1]  
> **Explanation:**Â The next interval of [2,3] is [3,4] having index â€˜1â€™. Similarly, the next interval of [3,4] is [5,6] having index â€˜2â€™. There is no next interval for [5,6] hence we have â€˜-1â€™.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:**Â Intervals [[3,4], [1,5], [4,6]]
> **Output:**Â [2, -1, -1]  
> **Explanation:**Â The next interval of [3,4] is [4,6] which has index â€˜2â€™. There is no next interval for [1,5] and [4,6].

```python
from heapq import *

def find_next_interval(intervals):
    # Get the number of intervals
    n = len(intervals)
    # Create two heaps, one for the start times and one for the end times of the intervals
    max_start_heap, max_end_heap = [], []

    # Push the start and end times of each interval onto their respective heaps
    for i in range(n):
        heappush(max_start_heap, (-intervals[i][0], i))
        heappush(max_end_heap, (-intervals[i][1], i))

    # Create a list to store the indices of the next intervals
    result = [-1 for _ in range(n)]

    # Iterate through the end time heap
    for _ in range(n):
        # Pop the interval with the maximum end time from the end time heap
        top_end, end_index = heappop(max_end_heap)
        # Check if the start time of the interval at the top of the start time heap is greater than or equal to the end time of the current interval
        if -max_start_heap[0][0] >= -top_end:
            # If it is, pop the interval with the maximum start time from the start time heap
            top_start, start_index = heappop(max_start_heap)
            # Keep popping intervals from the start time heap until we find an interval whose start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the current interval
            while max_start_heap and -max_start_heap[0][0] >= -top_end:
                top_start, start_index = heappop(max_start_heap)
            # Set the current interval as the next interval of the interval at the top of the end time heap
            result[end_index] = start_index
            # Push the popped intervals back onto the start time heap
            heappush(max_start_heap, (top_start, start_index))

    # Return the list of indices of the next intervals
    return result

intervals = [[3,4], [1,5], [4,6]]
print(find_next_interval(intervals))

intervals = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]]
print(find_next_interval(intervals))

intervals = [[3,4], [1,5], [4,6]]
print(find_next_interval(intervals))

intervals = [[2,3], [3,4], [5,6]]
print(find_next_interval(intervals))

intervals = [[1,2], [1,4], [1,6]]
print(find_next_interval(intervals))

# output:
[2, -1, -1]
[1, 2, 3, -1]
[2, -1, -1]
[1, 2, -1]
[-1, -1, -1]
```

In the case of intervalsÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`,Â `end_index`Â refers to the index of intervalÂ `B`Â in theÂ `intervals`Â list, andÂ `start_index`Â refers to the index of intervalÂ `A`Â in theÂ `intervals`Â list.

Here's an example to illustrate this. Let's say we have the following intervals:

intervalsÂ =Â [[1,Â 2],Â [3,Â 4],Â [5,Â 6]]

We push the start and end times of each interval onto their respective heaps and get the following heaps:

max_start_heap:Â [(-5,Â 2),Â (-3,Â 1),Â (-1,Â 0)]

max_end_heap:Â [(-6,Â 2),Â (-4,Â 1),Â (-2,Â 0)]

We pop the interval with the maximum end time from the end time heap, which is intervalÂ `C`Â with end timeÂ `6`. We check if the start time of the interval at the top of the start time heap is greater than or equal to the end time ofÂ `C`. It is not, so we move on to the next interval in the end time heap.

We pop the interval with the maximum end time from the end time heap again, which is intervalÂ `B`Â with end timeÂ `4`. We check if the start time of the interval at the top of the start time heap is greater than or equal to the end time ofÂ `B`. It is, so we pop the interval with the maximum start time from the start time heap, which is intervalÂ `A`Â with start timeÂ `1`. We keep popping intervals from the start time heap until we find an interval whose start time is greater than or equal to the end time ofÂ `B`. In this case, there are no more intervals in the start time heap that satisfy this condition.

We then setÂ `A`Â as the next interval ofÂ `B`Â by settingÂ `result[1] = 0`. We push the popped intervalÂ `A`Â back onto the start time heap.

TheÂ `end_index`Â in this case isÂ `1`, which is the index of intervalÂ `B`Â in theÂ `intervals`Â list. TheÂ `start_index`Â isÂ `0`, which is the index of intervalÂ `A`Â in theÂ `intervals`Â list. So the lineÂ `result[end_index] = start_index`Â setsÂ `A`Â as the next interval ofÂ `B`.
