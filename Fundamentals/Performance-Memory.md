## General

Stopping a program in case of error
```go
if err != nil {
  fmt.Printf("Program stopping with error %v", err)
  os.Exit(1)
}

// or:

if err != nil {
  panic("ERROR occurred: " + err.Error())
}
```

## Performance best practices and advice

Use []rune, if possible, instead of strings.
Use slices instead of arrays.

Use arrays or slices instead of a map where possible.

Use a for range over a slice if you only need the value and not the index; this is slightly faster than having to do a slice lookup for every element.

When the array is sparse (containing many 0 or nil-values), using a map can result in lower memory consumption.

Specify an initial capacity for maps.
When defining methods, use a pointer to a type (struct) as a receiver.

Use constants or flags to extract constant values from the code.

Use caching whenever possible when large amounts of memory are being allocated.
Use template caching.

## Memory considerations

For long-lived processes, deploy your Go applications on a 64-bit OS. Due to the current nature of the GC, big chunks of memory are pre-allocated, which could bring a long-lived Go process on a 32-bit machine to crash due to memory depletion. Other causes of memory leaks could be:

You keep creating goroutines that donâ€™t ever exit.

You keep appending to the same persistent slice (or writing to the same bytes.Buffer) and never resetting it.

You keep adding items to a persistent map without ever removing them.

Here is a code snippet to monitor memory usage:

```go
memstats := new(runtime.MemStats)
runtime.ReadMemStats(memstats)
log.Printf("memstats before GC: bytes = %d footprint = %d",
memstats.HeapAlloc, memstats.Sys)
```
