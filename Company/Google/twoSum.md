[1. Two Sum](http://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

```go
func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
    cache := make(map[int]int)

    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        another := target - nums[i]
        if _, ok := cache[another]; ok {
            return []int{cache[another], i}
        }
        cache[nums[i]] = i
    }
    return nil
}
```

Processing the two-sum problem in parallel and merging the results can be complex because the two numbers that add up to the target could be in different chunks of data. However, if the data is too large to fit into memory, you could use a divide-and-conquer approach where you divide the data into smaller chunks, process each chunk separately, and then merge the results.

Here's a high-level pseudocode of how you might do this:

Divide the input array into smaller chunks.
For each chunk, create a separate goroutine (or thread, if you're not using Go) that applies the two-sum algorithm to that chunk and stores the results in a shared data structure.
Wait for all goroutines to finish.
Merge the results from all chunks.
Please note that this approach requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions when accessing the shared data structure. Also, it doesn't guarantee that you'll find the two numbers if they are in different chunks.

If you're dealing with a truly massive amount of data, you might need to use a disk-based data structure like a B-Tree or a database system that can handle large datasets. Alternatively, you could use a distributed computing framework like MapReduce or Apache Spark that can process large datasets across multiple machines.


```go
import (
    "sync"
)

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    resultChan := make(chan []int, len(nums)/chunkSize+1)

    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i += chunkSize {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(chunk []int, offset int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            numMap := make(map[int]int)
            for i, num := range chunk {
                if j, ok := numMap[target-num]; ok {
                    resultChan <- []int{j + offset, i + offset}
                    return
                }
                numMap[num] = i
            }
        }(nums[i:min(i+chunkSize, len(nums))], i)
    }

    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(resultChan)
    }()

    for result := range resultChan {
        return result
    }

    return nil
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

const chunkSize = 1000  // Adjust this value based on your memory constraints
