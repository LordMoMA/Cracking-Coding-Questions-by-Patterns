[100181. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-122/problems/divide-an-array-into-subarrays-with-minimum-cost-i/)

You are given an array of integers nums of length n.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.

You need to divide nums into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,12]
Output: 6
Explanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [1], [2], and [3,12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The other possible ways to form 3 subarrays are:
- [1], [2,3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 12 = 15.
- [1,2], [3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 3 + 12 = 16.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,4,3]
Output: 12
Explanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [5], [4], and [3] at a total cost of 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.
It can be shown that 12 is the minimum cost achievable.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [10,3,1,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [10,3], [1], and [1] at a total cost of 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.
It can be shown that 12 is the minimum cost achievable.
 

Constraints:

3 <= n <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

```go
func minimumCost(nums []int) int {

}
```

100199. Find if Array Can Be Sorted

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.

In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent elements if they have the same number of set bits. You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).

Return true if you can sort the array, else return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]
Output: true
Explanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element. The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation "10", "100", and "1000" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation "1111" and "11110".
We can sort the array using 4 operations:
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].
The array has become sorted, hence we return true.
Note that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.

```go
func canSortArray(nums []int) bool {
    
}
```

Difficulty:Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing positive integers.

Your task is to minimize the length of nums by performing the following operations any number of times (including zero):

Select two distinct indices i and j from nums, such that nums[i] > 0 and nums[j] > 0.
Insert the result of nums[i] % nums[j] at the end of nums.
Delete the elements at indices i and j from nums.
Return an integer denoting the minimum length of nums after performing the operation any number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:
Operation 1: Select indices 2 and 1, insert nums[2] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [1,4,3,1,3], then delete elements at indices 2 and 1.
nums becomes [1,1,3].
Operation 2: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [1,1,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.
nums becomes [1,1].
Operation 3: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [1,1,0], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.
nums becomes [0].
The length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5,10,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:
Operation 1: Select indices 0 and 3, insert nums[0] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,10,5,5], then delete elements at indices 0 and 3.
nums becomes [5,5,5,5]. 
Operation 2: Select indices 2 and 3, insert nums[2] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,5,0], then delete elements at indices 2 and 3. 
nums becomes [5,5,0]. 
Operation 3: Select indices 0 and 1, insert nums[0] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [5,5,0,0], then delete elements at indices 0 and 1.
nums becomes [0,0].
The length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 2.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum achievable length. 
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows: 
Operation 1: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [2,3,4,3], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.
nums becomes [2,3].
Operation 2: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [2,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.
nums becomes [1].
The length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109

```go
func minimumArrayLength(nums []int) int {
    
}
```

100178. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II

User Accepted:34
User Tried:197

Difficulty:Hard

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n, and two positive integers k and dist.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.

You need to divide nums into k disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to dist. In other words, if you divide nums into the subarrays nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2 - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)], then ik-1 - i1 <= dist.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 5 - 2 = 3 which is equal to dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[5] which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
It can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,1,2,2,2,1], k = 4, dist = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [1], [2], and [2,2,1]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 3 - 1 = 2 which is less than dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] which is 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 15.
The division [10], [1], [2,2,2], and [1] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 5 - 1 = 4, which is greater than dist.
It can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays at a cost lower than 15.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [10,8,18,9], k = 3, dist = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [8], and [18,9]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 2 - 1 = 1 which is equal to dist.The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] which is 10 + 8 + 18 = 36.
The division [10], [8,18], and [9] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 3 - 1 = 2, which is greater than dist.
It can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 36.
 

Constraints:

3 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
3 <= k <= n
k - 2 <= dist <= n - 2

```go
func minimumCost(nums []int, k int, dist int) int64 {
    
}
