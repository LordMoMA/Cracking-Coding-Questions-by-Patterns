## Dynamic Programming

In this pattern, we will go through a set of problems to develop an understanding of DP. We will always start with a brute-force recursive solution to see the overlapping subproblems, i.e., realizing that we are solving the same problems repeatedly.

After the recursive solution, we will modify our algorithm to apply advanced techniques of Memoization and Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming to develop a complete understanding of this pattern.
